                           The /mlp/ Secret Santa (5+ years running) is an annual Holiday celebration and gift exchange.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                           What started in 2015 as a spontaneous exchange on /mlp/ with no more than 80 anons has since grown to a yearly event with over 300+ participants!. The event typically runs through October-January with the bulk of it centering around December. It fosters friendship and goodwill towards fellow pony fans as participants send each other letters, greeting cards, gifts, and care packages. We take this time out of the year to stop being so horrible to one another and embrace our mutual love of tiny horses.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                           If you would like to participate (whether you want to exchange just cards, a package, or both) click the sign up link in the navigation bar above! The forms are pretty self-explanatory.
                           After signups you will be randomly assigned both a gifter and a giftee. Remember, you’ll need to send a gift to get one back. Failure to do so bars you from future events.

                           Unfortunately people can be dicks, and a list exists of known ones to try and minimize the possibility during the
                           review process for the event. In the event that grinching happens SantaPone always taking names of kind anons willing to donate extra gifts to participants.
                           If you want to be on reserve to give gifts and don’t want any in return feel free to message event admins on your profile.

Due to postal delays from Covid-19 it is highly suggested you ship early as possible.

                           Gifts are exchanged round-robin style. Imagine anons sitting in a circle with each anon passing a gift to the person on their right. A gives to B gives to C gives to A.
                           The person assigned to gift you is not the same person you will be shopping for! When assignments go out you will receive all the info your anon filled out in the signup form,
                           like their favorite ponies and preferences.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           You will also receive a unique Holiday ID name for yourself, and one for your giftee so that you can use it when posting in thread
                           during unboxings or to communicate if need be. Have fun with it but understand this is not a free ticket to namefag shamelessly, please use your best judgement when posting with your ID!
                           Once you have your assignment it’s time to get shopping! Please keep your receipt(s) and tracking information for any and all packages if you are exchanging a gift! Always be sure to alert
                           SantaPone with the tracking information when you ship. The shark typically only needs to know the tracking number and carrier/website to use it with when you send a package from you to your
                           Santee or if you are mailing them items directly from the manufacturer.

                           crumbs or mess getting on to any other items. Avoid things that could melt or are easily crushed unless they are in well sealed containers. Be mindful of your giftees listed allergies or
                           preferences as well as any customs regulations if sending internationally.

                           Domestically, this is not supported through USPS but possible through other mail carriers, so do so at your discretion. Just be sure you wrap it securely and in a separate container in case of leaks or it

                           Non-alcoholic liquids/drinks are fine to send through USPS but you should always package them with extreme care and let the postal worker know your package contains liquids. Internationally, it's not suggested
                           to send any alcohol or liquids. Always be sure to heavily research the customs laws for the country you are shipping to before sending any food or drink. Consider sending non-liquid items such as tea, coffee,
                           hot cocoa mix, etc if customs allows.

                        <p>
                           Of course, it's encouraged not to send anything hazardous, medicinal, or outright illegal to posses. Do not send bodily fluids of any kind.

                        <p>
                           Cards are exchanged traditionally (you send to Anon #52 and he sends one back to you). You should receive a card back from each anon you send a card to but cards operate on the honor system. SantaPone can’t track paper letters.
                           Some anons send small gifts alongside their cards but this is entirely optional. Store-bought or homemade, it’s hard to go wrong with cards!

                           While any anon would be happy to receive these items it’s recommended to stick to exchanging cards if a drawing or story is the only thing you can send. However any type of fine art or crafts (paintings, sculpture, textile crafts)
                           is eligible as a great gift.

                           Please respect your anon's preference when it comes to lewd. Also be aware of common sense when decorating the outside of your anon's envelopes or packages. The post office will not send your item if it has a giant horse cock plastered on it.
                           Lewd is to be limited to the inside contents of cards and packages.

                        <p>
                           The $20-25 minimum (which does not include the cost you should set aside for shipping) is not a hard number perse but more a guideline of the value a gift should have. It can be one big item or multiple small items. If your anon is okay with handmade goods,
                           the perceived value of the handmade item should feel on-par with that amount. You don’t have to stress about hitting the exact number, just put heart and care into it! It’s always a great idea to include small inexpensive items like stickers, cards, letters,
                           etc with your gift to give it a personal touch while remaining within your budget and don’t forget to send a note or letter! If you opt to send items direct from an online shop please please please have the company/shop owner send along a personalized note for your anon.
                           Most if not every vendor should be happy to do this for you.

                           You can also occasionally find figures and items at thrift stores/yard sales if your Anon doesn't mind secondhand stuff.
                           Honestly consider it like adopting a sad pony from the pound.

                           If you are not in the US and Pone is hard to come by online vendors like Amazon are good options as well as Storenvy, TicTail,
                           Redbubble, Etsy and other online storefronts. Local treats are fun to send as well if your anon likes food, or small trinkets that represent your country.

                        <p>
                           If you want to get creative try your hand at making your giftee’s waifu (the plush threads can assist with tips and resources) or use a second-party website like Vistaprint,
                           or ArtsCow to create a huge variety of custom items! Do note though that some of these websites ship from China and can take a long time to process and deliver your order so you usually have to act fast.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           VistaPrint offers a wide selection of items to meme up and plaster ponies all over, plus much speedier shipping than Chinese sites! However they can be a little pricier.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           If you're buying something from Glorious China please also be sure it isn't a bootleg of an independent artist's product. The Chinese plushies are usually a safe gift but Dakis and artwork are most likely
                           theft so try to find the original artist! Nobody cares if you rip off Hasjew by using their vectors or free-to-enjoy meme images but be considerate of fan art and small artists' intellectual property.

                           hosting for the better part of this last year. Being that this is the case, as things move towards the actual event, costs for hosting will
                           go up, and while I don't forsee myself being unable to keep the hosting up, donations and help with the cost of platform hosting are greatly

               <h1>Privacy</h1>
               <p>
                  SantaDev here, here at SantaPone Central, we understand that privacy is an incredibly serious business. A bunch of folks from 4chan giving their information to other anons is a HUGE exercise in trust, and
                  security, credential protections, and authorization have been the absolute top focus of this whole project. As part of the development of this project, I want to be as transparent as I can with each and every
                  one of you about the tech stack used, how it is used, and how your data is protect to the highest degree.
               </p>
               <!-- Service Infrustructure Information -->
               <mat-toolbar>Service Infrastructure</mat-toolbar>
               <h2>Overview</h2>
               <p>SantaPone Central is a full stack application with an ASP.NET Web API backend, interfacing Auth0 for a stable and secure role-based management system, and Twilo Sendgrid as a privately used Azure service
                  of its own to have a secure way to deliver notifications and other information to users. The front end is an auth0 manged Angular Single-Page Application itself that utilizes best practice to make for a simple
                  and effective way for clients and event admins to manage and contribute to the event.
               </p>

               <mat-divider [inset]="true"></mat-divider>

               <h2>Back End</h2>
               <p>There are namely 3 parts to the backend infrastructure; the data service, the email service, and the auth0 service. All of these work together to ensure that data is valid, secure, and stateless.
                  A privately hosted Twilo Sendgrid solution is used to ensure that emails from the API are uniform, and specific to events, assignments, and correspondence to notify users of assignments, correspondence,
                  or any other things that need to be sent, such as password reset requests. The Auth0 service itself is used by utilizing the Auth0 management API itself, ensuring data security and proper credential handling.
                  Being that it as API running on it's own domain, requests are only allowed to come from this site, and the Auth0 tenants used in the data security layer. This specifically has been rigorously tested for fidelity to
                  ensure data security management.
               </p>

               <mat-divider [inset]="true"></mat-divider>

               <h2>Front End</h2>
               <p>The front end site you see before you was made with the Angular framework to deliver a nice, Single-Page Application web experience. I personally am a huge fan of Angular and the way type-safety and
                  services in-application can be accessed and handled. SantaPone Central is hosted on its own app platform service separate from the API to ensure that data calls and services are exclusively handled on the API
                  layer, and features data protection layers and services by Auth0 to manage user authorization and requests.
               </p>

               <mat-divider [inset]="true"></mat-divider>

               <h2>Sendgrid</h2>
               <p>Twilo Sendgrid is one of the services hosted privately within Azure. Rather simply, it is the service that allows the API to send secure emails about notifications and correspondence in general.</p>

               <mat-divider [inset]="true"></mat-divider>

               <h2>Hosting</h2>
               <p>The hosting of all of these services are hosted within Azure. If you are not familiar with service architectures, in short, similar services would be Amazon Web Services and CloudFlare. These are secure
                  and expandable cloud computing solutions that allow for a safe and consistent running environment. I use Azure specifically because it is what I am most familiar with, and it interfaces well with a lot of
                  the other Microsoft-based services and frameworks like SendGrid, or ASP.NET in general.
               </p>

               <!-- Auth0 Information -->
               <mat-toolbar>Auth0</mat-toolbar>
               <h2>What exactly is Auth0?</h2>
               <p>Auth0, in short is a security service that handles client login information and security</p>

               <mat-divider [inset]="true"></mat-divider>

               <h2>How secure is it?</h2>
               <p>To put it mildly, this is a security platform that AMD, Atlassian, and BlueCross BlueShield themeselves use. It provides a secure way to attach validation to requests that are made
                  with roles that define information about a user, allows for a safe API to manage password changes, and ensures that quite literally nothing gets past the security layer that shouldn't.
               </p>

               <mat-divider [inset]="true"></mat-divider>

               <h2>Passwords</h2>
               <p>For the sake of security, there are literally no passwords that are or ever will be stored on the database for SantaPone Central. All user credentials and security information is
                  handled exclusively by a privately paid and managed Auth0 tenant by yours truly to make sure every single one of your data is secure. Passwords, to that end, the only people who
                  can even see or change your password is... yourself. Not even myself can see or know your passwords.
               </p>

               <!-- Data Information -->
               <mat-toolbar>Data</mat-toolbar>
               <h2>What data is stored?</h2>
               <p>The goal of SantaPone Central is to literally keep the same process to the /SS/ event in a managed, easy-to-use way. That being said, the only things that are stored on the database
                  is the information that has always been asked for. Your names, emails, address, and survey questions are the only things that are asked for upon signing up, and are vigorously and strictly
                  locked behind auth0 for peace of mind and protection.
               </p>

               <mat-divider [inset]="true"></mat-divider>

               <h2>Who can access my data?</h2>
               <p>Auth0 allows for role-based authorization. That being said, the only people who can view your data are the admins, and the people who are set to send to yourself as an assignment. The
                  API has been carefully developed to make sure that the profile responses to users only gives the necessary data to that user, being the information SantaPone has always given in emails in
                  past events.
               </p>

               <mat-divider [inset]="true"></mat-divider>

               <h2>What about after the event?</h2>
               <p>After the Secret Santa Event, I plan to remove all the user data once SantaPone is able to download the tables needed for her own archival purposes in terms of knowing who grinched, or any other
                  information needed. Auth0 Accounts will also be deleted, and the data service will be brought offline until the need for the next event.
               </p>

               <mat-toolbar>Further Information</mat-toolbar>
               <p>Hundreds of hours went into the software development project for over half a year by quite literally just myself. The hosting services through the course of development, domains, certifications, and authorization
                  services are something I have been footing the bill for myself to make sure that this year had a nice tool for SantaPone and the other event organizers to have to help manage the event in
                  a way that would be easy for both you wonderful anons, and her to manage assignments, and bring cheer to more people. That being said, my goal here is to be as transparent and open to you all as possible,
                  and if any of you dev-happy anons would like to peek into the development of the application, feel free to reach out to me at <a href = "mailto: santaponecentraldev@gmail.com">santaponecentraldev@gmail.com</a>.
